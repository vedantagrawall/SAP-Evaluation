### 2. Summary Sections

#### Missing from Generated SAP
The following items are classified as `acceptable_difference` because they are present in the Original SAP as specific analysis sections or subsections but are not explicitly listed as high-level endpoints in the Protocol or the Generated SAP's summary list:
*   **TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation** and **TEAEs leading to death**: These are specific subsets of Adverse Events analyzed in the Original SAP (Sections 10.1.3 and 10.1.4). The Generated SAP and Protocol list the broader "Incidence and severity of AEs" which typically encompasses these subsets.
*   **Hypersensitivity Monitoring**: The Original SAP (Section 10.5) details specific vital sign criteria for hypersensitivity monitoring. The Protocol describes the procedure but lists "AESIs" and "Vital signs" as the endpoints. The Generated SAP follows the Protocol's endpoint list.
*   **Weight** and **Body Surface Area (BSA)**: The Original SAP (Section 10.3) explicitly lists these for analysis. The Protocol lists "Vital sign measurements" as the endpoint (though it mentions weight in the assessment section). The Generated SAP follows the Protocol's endpoint list.
*   **Salvage Treatment** and **Effusion Drainage**: These are specific efficacy-related analyses in the Original SAP (Sections 8.3 and 8.4) but are not listed as formal secondary endpoints in the Protocol or Generated SAP.

#### Contradictions
None. The Generated SAP aligns with the Protocol.
*   *Note:* The Primary Objective in the Generated SAP includes the phrase "up to Cycle 6", which matches the Protocol exactly. The Original SAP omits this phrase but implies it through the definition of the Induction Study Period. This is considered an alignment rather than a contradiction.

#### Extra in Generated SAP
None. All items in the Generated SAP are supported by the Protocol or Original SAP.

#### Overall Assessment
The Generated SAP accurately reflects the objectives and endpoints defined in the Protocol. It captures all primary and secondary objectives and endpoints found in the Original SAP. Some specific analysis subsections found in the Original SAP (e.g., specific AE subsets, weight, salvage treatment) are not listed as high-level endpoints in the Generated SAP, but this aligns with the Protocol's summary of endpoints. The Generated SAP is compliant with the Protocol.
