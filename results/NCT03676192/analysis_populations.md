### Summary

The Generated SAP accurately defines all analysis populations required by the Protocol (ITT, PP, PK, and Safety). It adheres strictly to the Protocol definitions, omitting operational details and eCRF references found in the Original SAP that were not specified in the Protocol. This approach is correct and compliant.
