  "reasoning": "The Generated SAP provides a solid set of definitions for populations, study periods, and efficacy endpoints, correctly incorporating the Protocol amendment regarding 'Response Duration' (including death) found in the Original SAP. However, it misses several standard definitions present in the Original SAP, such as Prior/Concomitant medications and TEAEs (though TEAEs are implied in analysis sections). A minor contradiction exists in the 'Duration of Treatment' calculation, where the Generated SAP uses a simple date difference while the Original SAP explicitly adds 21 days to account for the final cycle's duration. The ITT population definition in the Generated SAP matches the Protocol exactly, omitting a specific 'successfully screened' clause added in the Original SAP, which is acceptable.",
  "summary": "The Key Definitions section is decent, correctly capturing populations and efficacy endpoints consistent with the Protocol and Original SAP updates. However, it lacks explicit definitions for Prior/Concomitant medications and TEAEs, and the 'Duration of Treatment' calculation conflicts with the Original SAP's specific logic for dose intensity."
