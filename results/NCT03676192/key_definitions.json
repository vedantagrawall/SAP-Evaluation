Specifically, the definitions for Adverse Events (AE), Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) are completely absent. Additionally, the specific formula for calculating the Adjusted Carboplatin Dose (Calvert formula) and the Body Surface Area (BSA) calculation method are missing, despite being specified in the Protocol. While the Generated SAP includes basic definitions for study periods and baseline, the omission of these required safety and dosing definitions constitutes a significant gap. Many other specific derivation rules (e.g., dose intensity, QoL scoring, date imputation) are also missing, but these are classified as acceptable differences as they are not explicitly required by the Protocol.",
