Definitions for study dates, periods, and durations are consistent with the logic described in the Original SAP's disposition and concomitant medication sections. The Generated SAP explicitly defines terms like 'First Dose Date' and 'Last Dose Date' which are used implicitly in the Original SAP. There are no contradictions. The Generated SAP is missing specific formulas for 'Actual duration of dose' used for exposure analysis (Original SAP Section 7.2) and specific date imputation rules (though a placeholder exists), but these are acceptable omissions for a summary definitions section.",
