The Generated SAP definitions match the Protocol almost verbatim. 5) The Original SAP contains significant operational detail (eCRF references, specific dose definitions, mixed treatment logic) that is not in the Protocol. 6) Since the Generated SAP aligns with the Protocol, the omission of Original SAP's operational details and extra population is not a problem. 7) Rating is GREAT.",
