The Original SAP contains significant operational details (eCRF references, specific dosing definitions, treatment assignment logic) that are not present in the Protocol. 5) The Generated SAP omits these operational details and adheres almost verbatim to the Protocol text. 6) Since the Protocol is the tiebreaker, the Generated SAP is correct in all instances where it differs from the Original SAP. 7) The 'PK Population \u2013 Maintenance Period Subset' is present in the Original SAP but not the Protocol, so its omission is acceptable. 8) The rating is GREAT because the Generated SAP accurately reflects the Protocol requirements.",
