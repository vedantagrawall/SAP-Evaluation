  "reasoning": "The Generated SAP accurately extracts all objectives and endpoints from the Protocol. For the Primary Objective, it correctly matches the Protocol text ('up to Cycle 6') which was slightly abbreviated in the Original SAP. For Secondary Endpoints, specifically Response Duration, the Generated SAP correctly lists the Protocol definition in the Endpoints section (2.2.1), even though the Original SAP explicitly changed this definition in its 'Changes from Protocol' section (the Generated SAP correctly adopts the updated definition later in the Analysis section 6.2.2). The Generated SAP correctly identifies that there are no exploratory objectives defined in the Protocol. It adds an Estimand framework which is extra information but consistent with the study design.",
  "summary": "The Generated SAP provides an exact match to the Protocol's objectives and endpoints, correctly identifying all primary and secondary items. It appropriately handles discrepancies between the Protocol and Original SAP by adhering to the Protocol definitions in this section."
