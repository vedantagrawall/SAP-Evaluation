Instead, it proposes other standard sensitivity analyses (Complete Case, Unconfirmed Response). Since the Protocol does not explicitly require Tipping Point Analysis (it only mentions local review as sensitivity), this is an acceptable difference, though a notable deviation from the Original SAP's specific plan. \n\nThe Generated SAP also lacks the detailed logic for handling incomplete dates for new anticancer therapy and the specific formulas for the Delta method, which are present in the Original SAP. These are considered 'less_detailed' or 'missing_specification' but not critical failures as the general methods are correct. \n\nOverall, the Generated SAP is a solid draft that covers the essential regulatory and statistical requirements but lacks some of the specific granular details and one specific sensitivity analysis found in the Original SAP.",
