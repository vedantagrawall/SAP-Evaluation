The Generated SAP omits specific formatting rules found in the Original SAP (decimal places, 'Not Done' rows, LLOQ handling), but these omissions do not constitute contradictions. The Generated SAP adds standard details about software (SAS v9.4) and a priori/post hoc analysis definitions which are acceptable additions.",
