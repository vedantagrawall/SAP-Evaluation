Additionally, the Generated SAP omits specific analysis details required by the Original SAP, such as the 25th/75th percentiles, the pooling rule for the Country stratification factor, and the long-term landmark timepoints (24 and 36 months), while introducing a new timepoint (9 months). These are considered minor severity issues as they are easily correctable and do not fundamentally alter the trial design, but they represent a deviation from the specific instructions of the Original SAP.",
