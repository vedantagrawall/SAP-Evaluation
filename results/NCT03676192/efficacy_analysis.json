      "issue_type": "contradiction_original",
      "severity": "minor",
      "component": "Primary Analysis Context",
      "original_sap_text": "It is noted that the primary efficacy analysis (Section 8.1) was completed in the 1st CSR. In the final CSR, the analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed as a sensitivity analysis using the same method as 1st CSR.",
      "generated_sap_text": "The primary analysis of efficacy and safety is planned after all patients have completed Cycle 6 of the Induction Study Period... The primary analysis will compare the ORR between the CT-P16 and EU-Approved Avastin groups in both the ITT and PP populations.",
      "protocol_text": "The sponsor plans to prepare 3 CSRs... To report data after completion of the Induction Study Period... To report all data until the end of study.",
      "why_they_conflict": "The Original SAP is specifically for the Final CSR (3rd CSR) and states the primary analysis was already done in the 1st CSR. The Generated SAP is written as if it is the initial plan for the primary analysis.",
      "description": "The Generated SAP fails to reflect the specific context of the Original SAP (Version 3.0 for Final CSR), treating the primary analysis as a future event rather than a completed one being repeated as sensitivity.",
      "reasoning": "1) Original SAP says primary analysis was completed in 1st CSR and will be repeated as sensitivity in Final CSR. 2) Generated SAP says primary analysis is planned after Cycle 6. 3) These conflict because the Generated SAP ignores the study status (Final CSR). 4) Both cannot be true for the same document version."

  "reasoning": "The Generated SAP captures the core statistical methods (Logistic Regression, Kaplan-Meier, Cox Model) and endpoints (ORR, PFS, OS, TTP, Response Duration) correctly. However, it fails to reflect the specific context of the Original SAP, which is Version 3.0 for the Final CSR. The Original SAP explicitly states that the primary analysis was completed in the 1st CSR and is now a sensitivity analysis. The Generated SAP presents the primary analysis as the main planned analysis. Additionally, the Generated SAP omits detailed logic for handling incomplete dates for efficacy events and the specific requirement for a Tipping Point analysis for the primary endpoint, which are present in the Original SAP.",
  "summary": "The Generated SAP correctly identifies the efficacy endpoints and basic statistical methods but fails to capture the specific context of the Final CSR (treating the primary analysis as a sensitivity analysis). It also omits detailed date imputation logic and the tipping point analysis requirement."
