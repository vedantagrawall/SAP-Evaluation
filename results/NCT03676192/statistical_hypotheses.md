### Evaluation Summary Table

| Component | Evaluation Type | Matches Original SAP | Protocol Consulted | Result | Issue Type | Severity |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Primary Objective Definition | semantic | yes | yes | correct | none | none |
| Equivalence Criteria | semantic | yes | yes | correct | none | none |

### Extra Information Flagged

| Content | Contradicts | Detail |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Multiplicity Adjustment Statement | no | Original SAP is silent on explicit multiplicity statements but implies a single primary endpoint. Protocol sample size calculation confirms single endpoint design without adjustment. Generated SAP statement is correct and good practice. |
| Interim Analysis Statement | no | Original SAP outlines a reporting schedule (1st, 2nd, 3rd CSR) but is silent on 'interim analyses for early termination'. Protocol Section 7.6.7 explicitly states no interim analyses are planned. Generated SAP matches Protocol. |

### Missing from Generated SAP (0 items)

*No missing content.*

### Reasoning

The Generated SAP accurately captures the primary objective and equivalence criteria from the Original SAP. It includes explicit statements regarding multiplicity and interim analyses which, while not present in the Original SAP text, are confirmed by the Protocol and the study design (single primary endpoint, no stopping boundaries). These additions represent good statistical reporting practice.

### Summary

The Generated SAP correctly defines the primary hypothesis and equivalence margins (-12.5%, 12.5%) matching the Original SAP. It appropriately adds clarification regarding the absence of multiplicity adjustments and interim analyses for early termination, which is consistent with the Protocol.
