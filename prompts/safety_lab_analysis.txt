# Clinical Laboratory Safety Analysis Evaluation Prompt

You are evaluating a Generated SAP against an Original SAP for a clinical trial.

---

## DOCUMENTS PROVIDED

- **ORIGINAL SAP**: Human-written reference SAP
- **GENERATED SAP**: Auto-generated SAP being evaluated
- **PROTOCOL**: Source of truth when discrepancies arise

---

## YOUR TASK

Evaluate ONLY the clinical laboratory safety analysis content in the Generated SAP. This includes laboratory categories and parameters, analysis methods for lab data, toxicity grading standards and rules, shift table methodology, treatment-emergent abnormality definitions, data handling rules, unit standardization, and listing display conventions.

Do NOT evaluate adverse events, vital signs, ECG, immunogenicity, efficacy endpoints, or any other safety or non-safety content — those are evaluated in separate prompts.

**Start from the Generated SAP.** Find its clinical laboratory analysis section. Then find the corresponding content in the Original SAP for comparison. The Original SAP may have clinical laboratory content scattered across multiple sections — search the entire Original SAP for corresponding content.

---

## EVALUATION HIERARCHY

There are TWO separate checks. Do not conflate them.

### CHECK 1: EXISTENCE (Does the element exist?)

Use this hierarchy only when an entire component is absent from Generated SAP:
1. Check if element exists in Original SAP
2. If entirely absent from Generated SAP → Check Protocol
3. If element exists in Protocol → **PROBLEM** (missing required element) → classification = `missing_required`
4. If element only exists in Original SAP (not in Protocol) → **ACCEPTABLE** (not required) → classification = `acceptable_difference`

**CLASSIFICATION RULE**: The `classification` field in `missing_from_generated_sap` MUST be:
- `missing_required` → ONLY when `in_protocol` = "yes"
- `acceptable_difference` → ONLY when `in_protocol` = "no"

**When NOT to use Protocol:**
- Component exists in Generated SAP but is shorter/abbreviated → Do NOT check Protocol
- Component exists but omits qualifiers/details → Do NOT check Protocol
- These are CONTENT differences, not EXISTENCE differences

### CHECK 2: CONTENT (What does it say?)

Compare to Original SAP ONLY.

**DO NOT use Protocol to evaluate content differences. Protocol is ONLY for EXISTENCE checks.**

For CONTENT, ask these questions:
1. Does Generated SAP match Original SAP? → **CORRECT**
2. Does Generated SAP omit only minor wording but preserve ALL specifics? → **ACCEPTABLE**
3. Does Generated SAP omit methodological steps, specific values, or procedural details? → **PROBLEM** (missing_specification)
4. Does Generated SAP contradict Original SAP? → **PROBLEM** (contradiction)

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Generated SAP content matches Original SAP | **CORRECT** |
| Generated SAP has minor wording differences but includes all specifics | **ACCEPTABLE** |
| Original SAP has steps/rules/values, Generated SAP mentions concept but lacks specifics | **PROBLEM** (missing_specification) |
| Generated SAP says something DIFFERENT that contradicts Original SAP | **PROBLEM** (contradiction) |

**How to distinguish these categories:**
- ACCEPTABLE: Only minor wording omitted (adjectives, qualifiers, clarifying phrases). ALL methodology steps, rules, and specific values are still present.
- MISSING SPECIFICATION: Original SAP provides HOW (steps, rules, specific values). Generated SAP only says WHAT (mentions the method/concept but omits the specifics). This is a PROBLEM.
- CONTRADICTION: Generated SAP states something incompatible with Original SAP (cannot both be true)

**For EVERY contradiction, you MUST provide:**
1. FULL VERBATIM quote from Original SAP - do NOT truncate with "..." - include the complete sentence or paragraph
2. FULL VERBATIM quote from Generated SAP - do NOT truncate with "..." - include the complete sentence or paragraph
3. Chain-of-thought reasoning explaining:
   - What Original SAP says (with specific section reference)
   - What Generated SAP says (with specific section reference)
   - Why both statements cannot be true at the same time
   - The specific conflict between them

**QUOTE REQUIREMENT**: All quotes in issues, evaluation_table, and missing_from_generated_sap MUST be COMPLETE. Never use "..." to abbreviate. If a specification spans multiple sentences, include all of them.

---

## EVALUATION RULES

**CRITICAL**: Do not copy text between fields. The original_sap_text must come from the Original SAP document, not from Generated SAP. Quote VERBATIM text from each document first, then compare semantically. Do not paraphrase or summarize. **NEVER truncate quotes with "..." - always provide the COMPLETE text.**

**For ALL content types:**
- Compare to Original SAP first
- If Generated SAP matches Original SAP → CORRECT
- If Generated SAP contradicts Original SAP → PROBLEM
- Check if Original SAP contains any updates or amendments. If Generated SAP uses an old definition instead of the updated one, this is a contradiction

---

## EXTRA INFORMATION HANDLING

Generated SAP may contain content not present in Original SAP.

- Extra content that does NOT contradict → FLAG as extra, but NEUTRAL (do not penalize)
- Extra content that CONTRADICTS Original SAP → PROBLEM

---

## EVALUATION APPROACH

This evaluation has three phases. Complete each phase fully before the next.

### PHASE 1: EXTRACTION (from Generated SAP only)

1. Locate the clinical laboratory analysis section in the Generated SAP
2. Extract every distinct specification, rule, or methodological statement from that section
3. Each distinct rule, specification, or statement is a separate entry — do not bundle multiple rules into one entry
4. For each extracted item, record the EXACT TEXT (word-for-word quote)
5. Do not paraphrase or summarize
6. Create one entry per specification

**EXTRACTION GRANULARITY:**
Each of the following is a separate entry (when present):
- Each laboratory category or panel listed
- Each statement about which categories receive which type of analysis (descriptive stats, shift tables, listings)
- Each toxicity grading rule or specification
- Each shift table methodology statement
- Each treatment-emergent abnormality definition or rule
- Each unit standardization or conversion rule
- Each unscheduled or duplicate assessment handling rule
- Each study period assignment rule
- Each listing display convention or requirement
- Each baseline definition specific to lab data

**COUNT YOUR ELEMENTS:**
After extraction, count the total number of elements you extracted. Record this number - it will be verified later.

### PHASE 2: COMPARISON AND CLASSIFICATION

**TRACKING RULE:**
Every element extracted in Phase 1 MUST appear in the evaluation_table. No element can be skipped or lost.

**Step A — Part 1: Identify the Original SAP's clinical laboratory section boundaries.**
Find the Original SAP's dedicated clinical laboratory analysis section (e.g., "Clinical Laboratory Evaluations" or similar heading). Note the EXACT section heading where it starts and the EXACT next section heading where it ends. Record these in the JSON output under `original_sap_section_used`. You will ONLY use content between these two headings for the entire evaluation. Read that section carefully and note every sentence it contains — this is your ONLY source for comparison.

**SCOPE RESTRICTION — THIS IS ABSOLUTE:**
- You may ONLY use Original SAP content from within the clinical laboratory section boundaries identified above.
- Do NOT use content from general methods sections, general statistical considerations, analysis populations, efficacy, PK, adverse events, or ANY other section — even if that content mentions "EOT", "unscheduled", "baseline", "laboratory", or other lab-related terms.
- Each SAP section is evaluated by a separate prompt. Content from other sections is handled elsewhere. Using it here would be duplicating work and contaminating this evaluation.
- If a Generated SAP element has no corresponding content within the Original SAP's clinical laboratory section, record original_sap_text as null. Do NOT search other sections as a fallback.

**Step A — Part 2: Match elements.**
For each extracted element from the Generated SAP:
- Identify the key terms from the Generated SAP element
- Search ONLY within the Original SAP's clinical laboratory section (identified in Part 1) for those key terms
- When found, copy the EXACT sentence word-for-word as original_sap_text
- Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or reword what you find
- If no corresponding content exists within the clinical laboratory section, record original_sap_text as null

**MISSING FROM ORIGINAL SAP RULE:** If a specification exists in the Generated SAP but has no corresponding content anywhere in the Original SAP, assume the Generated SAP is correct. Place this item in the evaluation_table with original_sap_text: null, result: "correct", and note it as extra information. Do not penalize.

**CROSS-REFERENCE RULE:** When the Generated SAP references another section of itself for a definition or specification, accept the cross-reference as satisfying the requirement. When evaluating content that appears to be missing from the section being evaluated, you MUST first verify that the concept is truly absent from ALL sections of the Generated SAP before flagging it as missing. If the Generated SAP addresses a requirement through content defined in a different section, and the mechanism is consistent with the Original SAP's approach, do NOT flag it as missing - this is proper document organization.

**Critical instruction for missing_from_generated_sap:** Before adding any item to this array, confirm the content does not exist anywhere else in the Generated SAP. If the Generated SAP defines grouping categories, assignment logic, or specifications in a separate section and references or uses those definitions in the current section, this is NOT missing content. Only flag as missing if the mechanism of assignment or categorization actively CONTRADICTS the Original SAP's method.

**Assignment logic and categorization - CRITICAL RULE:** When Original SAP provides local assignment logic for categorizing data into groupings, and Generated SAP states it will categorize data using those same groupings but defines the groupings in a different section, do NOT add this to missing_from_generated_sap. The Generated SAP has satisfied the requirement through cross-referencing. The fact that assignment logic is in a different location is NOT a gap and NOT missing content - it is proper document organization. Only flag if: (1) the categories are undefined anywhere in the Generated SAP, OR (2) the Generated SAP's assignment mechanism actively contradicts the Original SAP's method. A difference in document organization is not a missing item.

When comparing against the Original SAP: if the Original SAP specifies that analyses will be performed using certain groupings or categories, and the Generated SAP defines those groupings or categories in a referenced section, this FULLY satisfies the requirement as long as the referenced definitions do not contradict the Original SAP's stated approach. Only flag a contradiction if the Generated SAP's approach to how data is assigned or grouped actively conflicts with the Original SAP's stated method. A difference in where a definition or assignment logic is located is NOT a contradiction and NOT a missing item.

**Step B**: Compare statements directly

**MULTI-RULE CHECK:** For each Generated SAP element, do not only compare it to its matched Original SAP statement from Step A. Also check it against ALL OTHER statements within the Original SAP's clinical laboratory section. A Generated SAP element about visit scope must be checked against all clinical laboratory section statements about visit inclusion/exclusion. A Generated SAP element about analysis types must be checked against all clinical laboratory section statements about which parameters receive which analyses. If any statement within the clinical laboratory section contradicts the Generated SAP element, flag it as a contradiction — even if a different statement was the primary match. Remember: only use statements from within the clinical laboratory section boundaries.

**EXPLICIT CONSTANT RULE:** When the Original SAP states an explicit numeric constant to use in a formula, that stated constant is the governing instruction. Any parenthetical derivation, rationale, or approximation is explanatory context, not an alternative value. If the Generated SAP uses a different number than the explicitly stated constant, this is a contradiction.

**CONTRADICTION VS MISSING DISTINCTION:** A contradiction requires the Generated SAP to actively state something incompatible with the Original SAP. If the Generated SAP is silent on a topic — it does not mention it at all — that is a missing item, not a contradiction. Only flag as contradiction when both documents address the same topic and their statements cannot both be true at the same time.

**DISPLAY STRATEGY VS CONTRADICTION - CRITICAL CHECK:** Before flagging as contradiction, verify this is a true methodological conflict, not a display difference. If the Generated SAP states that data will be categorized or assigned using specific groupings, and those groupings are defined anywhere in the Generated SAP, then the underlying analysis method is satisfied. The fact that the Generated SAP may also present data using alternative or additional display formats does not contradict the underlying categorization method. Only flag as contradiction if: (1) the Generated SAP fails to use the required categorizations at all, OR (2) the Generated SAP's assignment mechanism actively conflicts with how the Original SAP specifies data should be assigned. Differences in table organization, column structure, or presentation format are NOT methodological contradictions if the underlying categorizations are defined and being used.

- Ask: "Can both statements be true at the same time?" AND "Is this just a difference in display/presentation format?"
- If YES to either question → matches_original_sap: "yes" (no conflict, statements are compatible)
- If NO to both → matches_original_sap: "no" (contradiction, statements conflict)

**Step C**: Determine detail_level
- match: Generated SAP text is equivalent to Original SAP text
- less_detailed: Generated SAP omits words/clauses but core meaning preserved
- contradiction: Generated SAP states something incompatible with Original SAP

**Step D**: For less_detailed items, document omissions
- Record exactly what words, clauses, rules, or values were omitted in `omitted_content`
- Assess `omission_impact`: none | low | potential (could this omission change meaning?)

**Step E**: After completing the evaluation table, check the Original SAP for clinical laboratory content that is present in the Original SAP but absent from the Generated SAP. List these in `missing_from_generated_sap` for informational tracking. Missing items do NOT affect the rating.

**BLOCKING CHECK before adding to missing_from_generated_sap:** If the Original SAP content is assignment logic or categorization logic that specifies how to assign data to specific groupings or categories, STOP. Ask: Does the Generated SAP state that data will be categorized or grouped using those same categories? If YES, then check: Are those categories defined anywhere in the Generated SAP? If YES, do NOT add this to missing_from_generated_sap regardless of where the definitions are located or whether the local assignment logic differs. The requirement is satisfied if the Generated SAP uses the categories and they are defined. Only add to missing_from_generated_sap if: (1) Generated SAP does not state data will be categorized by those groupings, OR (2) the categories are undefined anywhere in the Generated SAP, OR (3) the Generated SAP explicitly contradicts the categorization method.

For each missing item, check Protocol:
- Search the ENTIRE Protocol document for the same element
- Content may be worded differently - look for semantic match
- Record in_protocol: "yes" if concept exists (even if worded differently)
- Record in_protocol: "no" ONLY if concept is truly absent after thorough search

**Step F (Reverse Contradiction Check)**: After completing Steps A-E, perform this mandatory cross-check. You MUST produce output for this step in the `reverse_check` field of your JSON output.

Go through the Original SAP's clinical laboratory section (within the boundaries identified in Step A — Part 1, and ONLY that section) and identify EVERY statement that involves restriction or scope language — words like "will not", "not be", "excluded", "only", "unless", "restricted to", "limited to", or similar. These are the statements most likely to be contradicted. Do NOT use statements from any other section of the Original SAP.

For EACH such statement:
1. Write down the Original SAP statement verbatim
2. Scan EVERY element in your evaluation_table and ask: "Does this Generated SAP element say something that contradicts this Original SAP statement?" — do NOT skip elements just because they were matched to a different Original SAP rule
3. Specifically check: if the Original SAP EXCLUDES something, does any Generated SAP element INCLUDE it? If the Original SAP INCLUDES something, does any Generated SAP element EXCLUDE it?
4. Record your finding in the reverse_check array (even if no contradiction found)
5. If you find a new contradiction, add it to the issues array AND update the relevant evaluation_table entry

The reverse_check array MUST contain at least 5 entries. If you found fewer than 5 restriction/scope statements in the Original SAP, also include statements about methodology rules and analysis requirements.

### PHASE 3: OUTPUT COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION

**OUTPUT COMPLETENESS RULE:**
Your evaluation_table must contain exactly the same number of entries as elements_extracted (from Phase 1). The missing_from_generated_sap array is separate and tracks Original SAP content not found in the Generated SAP.

Before generating output:
1. Count your extracted elements from Phase 1
2. Ensure every single one has a corresponding entry in evaluation_table
3. elements_extracted = elements_in_evaluation_table
4. Do NOT consolidate, summarize, or merge entries in the output
5. **SECTION BOUNDARY VERIFICATION:** For every `original_sap_text` in your evaluation_table, issues, and reverse_check, verify that the quoted text actually appears within the Original SAP section you declared in `original_sap_section_used`. If a quote comes from a different section (e.g., general methods, PK, efficacy), you MUST replace it with null or with the correct quote from the clinical laboratory section. If there is no equivalent text in the clinical laboratory section, set original_sap_text to null.

If counts do not match, add the missing entries before proceeding.

## RATING CRITERIA

Rating is based ONLY on contradictions. Missing information does NOT affect the rating under any circumstances. Do not consider omissions, missing items, or level of detail when determining the rating.

A section with 0 contradictions MUST be rated GREAT, regardless of how many items are missing or omitted.

**SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDE:**

A contradiction's severity depends ONLY on its impact on the trial's statistical conclusions and regulatory integrity, NOT on clinical knowledge about the study drug or disease.

**CRITICAL RULE: Do NOT use clinical knowledge or therapeutic area expertise to determine severity. Base severity classification ONLY on the structural criteria below.**

**Critical** — A contradiction is critical ONLY when it would change the statistical conclusions of the trial, affect primary endpoint analysis, hypothesis testing, or alpha control, alter analysis population definitions, contradict a regulatory requirement stated in the Protocol, remove an entire required analysis for a primary or key secondary endpoint, or make the Generated SAP internally inconsistent in a way that prevents execution.

**Minor** — A contradiction is minor when it reduces the scope of summary or display tables without affecting statistical conclusions, changes the presentation format of results for supportive or ancillary parameters, omits or changes analysis details for ancillary, exploratory, or non-primary parameters, differs on the breadth of reporting without contradicting the core methodology, or affects completeness of reporting without changing the statistical approach.

When in doubt, ask: "Would this contradiction change the regulatory reviewer's ability to assess the primary and key secondary endpoints?" If no, it is minor. Do NOT consider clinical significance of specific parameters or drug-specific safety profiles.

### GREAT
- No contradictions between Generated SAP and Original SAP
- No contradictions with Protocol
- No internal contradictions
- This is the correct rating even if many items are missing or less detailed

### DECENT
- Minor contradictions that do not affect trial integrity
- Small inconsistencies easily correctable
- No Protocol contradictions

### POOR
- Critical contradictions with Protocol
- Generated SAP states something fundamentally incompatible with Original SAP that would affect statistical conclusions or regulatory integrity
- Multiple contradictions where at least one is critical
- Internal contradictions that prevent the SAP from being executed as written

## BLOCKING VALIDATION

**counts_match MUST be true for valid output.**

Before finalizing your output, verify:
- `elements_extracted` = `elements_in_evaluation_table` (every element extracted from the Generated SAP must have an evaluation_table entry)
- `elements_extracted` = sum of all values in `elements_per_section`
- `missing_from_generated_sap` is a SEPARATE count — it tracks Original SAP content not found in the Generated SAP and does NOT factor into the extraction count
- If the counts do not match, your output is INVALID - go back and find the missing elements

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Extract from Generated SAP**: Locate the clinical laboratory analysis section in the Generated SAP and extract every distinct specification, rule, and methodological statement.
2. **Search entire Original SAP**: For each extracted element, search the ENTIRE Original SAP for corresponding content — clinical laboratory content may be scattered across multiple sections.
3. **One entry per specification**: Each distinct rule, grading specification, handling rule, or display convention is its own evaluation_table entry. Do not bundle.
4. **EXISTENCE vs CONTENT**: Protocol is ONLY for checking if missing elements are required, NOT for evaluating content differences.
5. **Compare to Original SAP first**: For content, always compare Generated SAP to Original SAP.
6. **Contradiction is a problem**: Generated SAP saying something incompatible with Original SAP is a problem.
7. **Extra info is neutral**: Flag but do not penalize extra information unless it contradicts.
8. **Blocking validation**: Ensure counts_match is true before outputting.
9. **Full quotes required**: NEVER use "..." to truncate quotes - always include complete text.
10. **Rating based on contradictions only**: Missing information does NOT affect rating. Track missing items informationally but do not penalize.
11. **Explicit constants govern**: When the Original SAP states an explicit numeric constant in a formula, that constant is the instruction. A parenthetical derivation or rationale does not override it. If the Generated SAP uses a different number, it is a contradiction.
12. **Silence is not contradiction**: If the Generated SAP does not mention a topic at all, that is missing — not a contradiction. A contradiction requires both documents to address the same topic with incompatible statements.
13. **Scope**: ONLY evaluate clinical laboratory analysis content. Do NOT evaluate adverse events, vital signs, ECG, immunogenicity, efficacy endpoints, or any other content.
