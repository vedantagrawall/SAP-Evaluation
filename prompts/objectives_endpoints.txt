You are evaluating a Generated SAP against an Original SAP for a clinical trial.

DOCUMENTS PROVIDED

ORIGINAL SAP: Human-written reference SAP (primary comparison)
GENERATED SAP: Auto-generated SAP being evaluated
PROTOCOL: Source of truth when discrepancies arise


YOUR TASK
Evaluate the Objectives and Endpoints content in the GENERATED SAP.
Discover what objectives and endpoints exist across all documents. Do not check against a predefined list of expected items.

IMPORTANT: You MUST create separate rows for each individual endpoint. Never bundle multiple endpoints into one row. Each objective and each endpoint gets its own evaluation row.

Instead:

SEARCH the Protocol to find what objectives and endpoints exist
SEARCH the entire Original SAP to find where this content appears
SEARCH the entire Generated SAP to find where this content appears
Compare the CONTENT regardless of location
Only consult Protocol when Generated SAP differs from Original SAP


COMPARISON ORDER
Step 1: Compare Generated SAP to Original SAP first
Step 2: If they match → CORRECT, no further investigation needed
Step 3: If they differ → Go to Protocol as tiebreaker
Step 4: If Generated SAP matches Protocol → CORRECT, do not penalize even if Original SAP differs
Step 5: If Generated SAP matches neither Original SAP nor Protocol → PROBLEM
This order is intentional. Original SAPs sometimes contain conduct-specific adjustments that our auto-generator cannot anticipate. Protocol determines correctness.

LOCATION FLEXIBILITY
Content may appear in DIFFERENT SECTIONS across all three documents. The same information might be organized completely differently in each document.
SEARCH the entire document. Section names and locations are irrelevant.
Only the accuracy of the content matters.

EVALUATION RULES
Objectives:

Must match Protocol language exactly
The language should not change at all
If Generated SAP differs from Original SAP → check Protocol
If Generated SAP matches Protocol → CORRECT

Endpoints:

Should align with Protocol
Adding specificity to a vague Protocol definition is acceptable
Changing, adding, or removing clinical/statistical meaning is a difference that must be recorded
If Generated SAP changes what is being measured → PROBLEM

Exploratory Objectives/Endpoints:

If Protocol defines them and Generated SAP omits them → PROBLEM
If Protocol has NONE and Generated SAP shows none or flags "Gap: no exploratory objectives defined" → NEUTRAL, do not penalize

Estimands:

Estimands are SAP-specific content, typically not in Protocol
Compare to Original SAP


EXTRA INFORMATION HANDLING
Generated SAP may contain information not present in Original SAP.

Extra information that does NOT contradict → FLAG as extra, but NEUTRAL (do not penalize)
Extra information that CONTRADICTS Original SAP or Protocol → PROBLEM


RATING
GREAT: Objectives match Protocol language. Endpoints align appropriately. Nothing contradicted.
DECENT: Minor issues that do not affect trial integrity. Small discrepancies that are easily correctable.
POOR: Critical issues present:

Objectives differ from Protocol
Endpoints missing or meaning changed
Exploratory content defined in Protocol but omitted from Generated SAP
Extra information that contradicts Protocol or Original SAP


OUTPUT FORMAT
Return BOTH a markdown table AND JSON.

### Reasoning
[Step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning trace:]
1. What I found in Protocol for objectives/endpoints
2. What I found in Original SAP
3. What I found in Generated SAP
4. How I compared them (Original SAP first, then Protocol as tiebreaker)
5. Where discrepancies were found
6. How each was resolved
7. Why this rating was assigned

PROCESS

1. Read PROTOCOL - identify all objectives and endpoints present
2. Read ORIGINAL SAP - identify all objectives, endpoints, estimands present
3. Read GENERATED SAP - identify all objectives, endpoints, estimands present
4. For EACH item found:
   - Extract the full definition text from Generated SAP, Original SAP, and Protocol
   - Compare the actual definition text, not just the component name
   - If a component contains multiple items, create a separate evaluation row for each item
   - Text matches only if the definition text is identical or nearly identical. Additional clauses, conditions, or qualifiers constitute a difference.
   - If Generated SAP and Original SAP text match → CORRECT, no further investigation
   - If they differ → consult Protocol as tiebreaker
   - If Generated SAP matches Protocol but Original SAP differs → record what Original SAP contains that differs from Protocol
   - If Original SAP contains more detail than Protocol, record this difference even when Generated SAP correctly matches Protocol
   - Determine evaluation type (exact_match for objectives, semantic for endpoints, judgment for estimands)
   - Record result

5. Check if Generated SAP includes any items not present in Protocol. Compare each individual item, not bundled groups. Flag these as extra information and assess for contradiction.
6. Check for exploratory content: Does Protocol define any? Does Generated SAP include or flag absence?
7. Check for estimands: Compare to Original SAP
8. Document all findings with ACTUAL TEXT QUOTES
9. Write reasoning explaining your evaluation process
10. Assign rating


IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- Original SAPs may reflect trial conduct decisions that deviate from Protocol for legitimate reasons we cannot know
- When in doubt, Protocol is the source of truth
- Do not penalize the Generated SAP for matching Protocol when Original SAP differs
- Do not penalize explicit "Gap" flags when Protocol lacks that content
- Do not penalize extra information unless it contradicts
- When comparing, always compare the actual text, not just the presence of a component name
