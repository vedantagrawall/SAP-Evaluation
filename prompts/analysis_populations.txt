# Analysis Populations Evaluation Prompt

You are evaluating a Generated SAP against an Original SAP for a clinical trial.

---

## DOCUMENTS PROVIDED

- **ORIGINAL SAP**: Human-written reference SAP
- **GENERATED SAP**: Auto-generated SAP being evaluated
- **PROTOCOL**: Source of truth when discrepancies arise

---

## YOUR TASK

Evaluate the Analysis Population content in the Generated SAP.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not assume which populations exist. Discover all populations present across all three documents by searching each document thoroughly.

---

## EVALUATION HIERARCHY

Follow this order strictly:

1. **Compare Generated SAP to Original SAP first**
2. **If they match** → CORRECT, no further investigation needed
3. **If they differ** → Go to Protocol as tiebreaker
4. **If Generated SAP matches Protocol** → CORRECT (do not penalize, even if Original SAP differs)
5. **If Generated SAP matches neither Original SAP nor Protocol** → PROBLEM

### Special Cases

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Population in Protocol + Original SAP, but ABSENT from Generated SAP | **PROBLEM** (absence) |
| Population in Original SAP only (not in Protocol), absent from Generated SAP | **NOT A PROBLEM** |
| Extra detail in Original SAP not in Protocol, omitted by Generated SAP | **NOT A PROBLEM** |
| Extra information in Generated SAP that does not contradict | **FLAG** but neutral (not a problem) |
| Extra information in Generated SAP that contradicts | **PROBLEM** |

---

## WHAT TO EVALUATE FOR EACH POPULATION

For each analysis population, evaluate THREE components:

| Component | Evaluation Type | Comparison Rule |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Name** | exact_match | Compare to Original SAP first; if different, check Protocol as tiebreaker |
| **Definition** | semantic | Compare to Original SAP first; if different, check Protocol as tiebreaker |
| **Treatment Assignment** | semantic | Compare to Original SAP first; if different, check Protocol as tiebreaker |

**All three components follow the same evaluation hierarchy:**
1. If Generated SAP matches Original SAP → CORRECT
2. If Generated SAP differs from Original SAP → Consult Protocol
3. If Generated SAP matches Protocol → CORRECT (even if Original SAP differs)
4. If Generated SAP matches neither → PROBLEM

---

## DISCOVERY PROCESS

### Step 1: Search Protocol
- Search the entire Protocol document for analysis populations/analysis sets
- List ALL populations defined
- Record exact text for each: name, definition, treatment assignment

### Step 2: Search Original SAP
- Search the entire Original SAP document for analysis populations
- List ALL populations defined
- Record exact text for each: name, definition, treatment assignment

### Step 3: Search Generated SAP
- Search the entire Generated SAP document for analysis populations
- List ALL populations defined
- Record exact text for each: name, definition, treatment assignment

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Population

For each population found in Protocol:
1. Check if present in Generated SAP (if absent → PROBLEM)
2. Compare name (exact_match)
3. Compare definition (semantic)
4. Compare treatment assignment (semantic)
5. If Generated SAP differs from Original SAP → consult Protocol
6. Record Protocol text when consulted

---

## HANDLING ORIGINAL SAP CONTENT NOT IN GENERATED SAP

After evaluating the three components (name, definition, treatment assignment), also identify any content in the Original SAP that is NOT present in the Generated SAP.

This includes:
- Operational details (eCRF page references, data field names)
- Additional exclusion criteria
- Specific assignment logic (kit numbers, database lookups)
- Additional populations not in Protocol
- Any other content present in Original SAP but absent from Generated SAP

For each item found:
1. Quote the Original SAP text
2. Note whether this content is also in the Protocol
3. Describe what is missing

This is for documentation purposes. If the content is not in Protocol, it is not a problem that Generated SAP omits it. But it should be recorded to show the difference.

---

## RATING CRITERIA

### GREAT
- All Protocol-required populations present
- Names match (per evaluation hierarchy)
- Definitions semantically match
- Treatment assignments correct
- No contradictions

### DECENT
- All Protocol-required populations present
- Minor wording differences that do not change meaning
- Small issues easily correctable
- No critical omissions

### POOR
- Protocol-required population completely absent
- Names differ without justification from Protocol
- Definitions have materially different meaning
- Treatment assignment wrong or missing
- Contradictions exist

### Reasoning

[Step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning trace:]
1. What populations I found in Protocol
2. What populations I found in Original SAP
3. What populations I found in Generated SAP
4. How I compared each population (Original SAP first, then Protocol as tiebreaker)
5. Where differences were found
6. When Protocol was consulted and what it said
7. Why this rating was assigned

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Discovery first**: Do not assume populations exist - search and find them in each document
2. **Compare to Original SAP first**: Always compare Generated SAP to Original SAP before consulting Protocol
3. **Protocol is tiebreaker**: Only consult Protocol when Generated SAP differs from Original SAP
4. **Do not penalize Protocol compliance**: If Generated SAP matches Protocol but not Original SAP, that is CORRECT
5. **Document everything**: Include actual text quotes for audit trail
6. **Absence is only a problem if required by Protocol**: Missing a population that Protocol defines is a PROBLEM; missing one only in Original SAP is not
7. **Three components per population**: Always evaluate name, definition, and treatment assignment for each population
8. **Location flexibility**: Content may appear in different sections across documents - search entire documents
9. **Quote actual text**: Always provide exact quotes from documents
10. **Explain Protocol consultations**: When you consult Protocol, document what it says and how it resolved the discrepancy
