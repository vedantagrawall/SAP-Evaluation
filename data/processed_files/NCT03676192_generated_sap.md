# Section 3.3: Analysis Populations

The following analysis populations are defined for the study:

# Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population

The ITT population is defined as all patients randomly assigned to study drug, regardless of whether or not any study treatment dosing is completed. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on randomization.

# Per-Protocol (PP) Population

The PP population is defined as all randomly assigned patients who have at least one response evaluation after receiving at least one full dose of study drug (CT-P16 or EU-Approved Avastin) in the Induction Study Period and who do not have any major protocol deviation. A major protocol deviation is one that may affect the interpretation of the primary endpoint and it will be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Final determinations of the PP population will be made at the blinded data review meeting before unblinding. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on randomization.

# PK Population

The PK population is defined as all patients who receive at least one full dose of study drug (CT-P16 or EU-Approved Avastin) and who have at least one post treatment PK result. If any patients are found to be non-compliant with respect to dosing, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis at the blinded data review meeting before unblinding. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on treatment actually received.

# Safety Population

The safety population is defined as all randomly assigned patients who receive at least one dose (full or partial) of study drug (CT-P16 or EU-Approved Avastin). Patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on treatment actually received.

# Section 3.4: Timing of Analysis

# 3.4.1 Safety Reviews

An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review and evaluate accumulating safety data throughout the study to ensure the safety of study patients. The purpose of these reviews is to monitor the risk-benefit profile of the study treatments.

[GAP: Frequency and timing of DSMB safety reviews are not specified in the protocol - complete or change to reference a separate document titled "DSMB Charter"].

# 3.4.2 Induction Study Period Analysis

The study will be unblinded to pre-defined personnel from the Sponsor and Contract Research Organization (CRO) for reporting purposes after all patients have completed Cycle 6 of the Induction Study Period. This analysis will include the primary efficacy endpoint (ORR up to Cycle 6) as described in Section 2.1.1.

The study will remain blinded to the investigators, patients, and pre-defined blinded personnel until the final database lock at study completion.

# 3.4.3 One-Year Follow-up Analysis

A second analysis and Clinical Study Report (CSR) are planned to report data collected up to one year after the last patient has completed the study treatment or discontinued. The primary purpose of this analysis is to evaluate secondary efficacy endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and long-term safety.

# 3.4.4 Final Analysis

The final analysis will be performed after all patients have completed the study (including the Follow-Up Period) or have discontinued from the study, and the database has been finalized.

The end of the study is defined as the date of final database lock. This analysis will be the basis for the final CSR and will include all efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, and quality of life data collected during the Whole Study Period.

# Section 3.7: Decision Criteria/Statistical Hypotheses

The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy similarity between CT-P16 and EU-Approved Avastin. The statistical hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint (Objective Response Rate [ORR] up to Cycle 6, as defined in Section 2.1.1) is framed as an equivalence test.

The null hypothesis (H₀) is that the difference in ORR between CT-P16 (πT) and EU-Approved Avastin (πR) is outside the pre-specified equivalence margin (δ) of ±12.5%:

H₀: πT - πR ≤q -12.5% or πT - πR ≥q 12.5%

The alternative hypothesis (HA) is that the difference in ORR between CT-P16 and EU-Approved Avastin is contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ±12.5%:

HA: -12.5% &#x3C; πT - πR &#x3C; 12.5%

All statements of efficacy similarity will be based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in ORR, which is equivalent to two one-sided tests each at the 0.025 level of significance.

The decision criterion for declaring therapeutic equivalence is that the 95% CI for the difference in ORR (CT-P16 minus EU-Approved Avastin) must be entirely contained within the interval (-12.5%, 12.5%). This analysis will be performed for both the Intent-to-treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) populations (as defined in Section 3.3), with both required to meet the equivalence criterion for a definitive conclusion of similarity.

Formal hypothesis testing will not be performed for the secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in Section 2.2.1), including OS, PFS, TTP, and response duration. These endpoints will be


evaluated descriptively. The results will be summarized and presented in the final CSR, but no formal statistical conclusions will be drawn regarding these secondary endpoints.

The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will provide additional context to the primary efficacy results and will help to inform the overall understanding of the treatment's impact on patient outcomes.

In summary, while the primary analysis focuses on demonstrating equivalence in ORR between CT-P16 and EU-Approved Avastin, the secondary analyses will enrich the data set and provide insights into the broader efficacy and safety profile of the treatment under investigation.

summarized using descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier methods as supportive evidence of similarity. Multiplicity adjustments are further described in Section 4.3.

# Section 4.1: General Methodology

All analyses described in this plan will be performed using SAS software version 9.4 or higher unless specified otherwise.

The analyses documented here are considered a priori analyses in that they are defined prior to database lock. Changes to the planned analyses, if any, designed after database lock and/or unblinding will be considered post hoc analyses and will be applied as exploratory methodology. All post hoc analyses will be identified in the clinical study report.

The term "descriptive statistics" refers to the number of patients (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum for continuous variables; and refers to the number and percentage of patients for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics will be presented as described here unless specified otherwise in the efficacy or safety sections of this document.

Unless specified otherwise, confidence intervals will be presented as 95% and p-values will be presented as 2-sided. For the primary efficacy analysis of objective response rate (ORR), the equivalence testing approach utilizing two one-sided tests at the 0.025 level of significance will be used, as described in Section 3.7.

Unless specified otherwise, summaries will be presented by treatment arm (CT-P16 or EU-Approved Avastin), study period (Induction Study Period, Maintenance Study Period, and/or Whole Study Period, as defined in Section 3.4), and overall.

Adverse events (AEs) will be coded to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) current version at the time of database lock. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded to drug class and PT using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.

All data collected will be listed by patient, treatment, and visit where applicable. All analysis populations (as defined in Section 3.3) will be identified in the listings. Summaries and tabulations will be based on the analysis populations specified for each endpoint in Section 2.
# Section 4.2: Key Definitions

| Last Visit Date                            | The date of the last study-related contact with the patient, which may be the date of the last follow-up visit, date of death, or date of withdrawal of consent.         |
| Last Visit Date (Induction Study Period)   | The date of the end-of-cycle assessment for Cycle 6 (or the End of Treatment \[EOT] visit if the patient discontinues during the Induction Study Period).                |


# Last Visit Date (Maintenance Study Period)

The date of the EOT visit performed after discontinuation of monotherapy.

# Baseline Value

The baseline value is defined as the last non-missing assessment (including laboratory tests, vital signs, and tumor assessments) performed prior to the First Dose Date. If multiple assessments are performed on the same day, the assessment with a time recorded prior to the first dose time will be used. If time is not available, the assessment will be assumed to be pre-dose. [GAP: Definition of baseline for tumor assessments needs confirmation if the Screening assessment is >28 days prior to Day 1 due to CNS extension].

# Change from Baseline Value

Calculated as (Post-baseline Value - Baseline Value).

# Study Day 1

The First Dose Date (Induction Study Period).

# Study Day

The day relative to Study Day 1. If the date of interest is on or after Study Day 1: Study Day = (Date of Interest - Study Day 1) + 1. If the date of interest is prior to Study Day 1: Study Day = (Date of Interest - Study Day 1). There is no Study Day 0.

# Duration of Treatment

Calculated as (Last Dose Date - First Dose Date) + 1.

# Duration of Treatment (Induction Study Period)

Calculated as (Last Dose Date [Induction Study Period] - First Dose Date [Induction Study Period]) + 1.

# Duration of Treatment (Maintenance Study Period)

Calculated as (Last Dose Date [Maintenance Study Period] - First Dose Date [Maintenance Study Period]) + 1.

# Duration of Study

Calculated as (Last Visit Date - First Visit Date) + 1.

# Screening Period

The period from the First Visit Date (ICF signature) up to the day before Study Day 1.

# Induction Study Period

The period starting from Study Day 1 through the last assessment of Cycle 6 (nominally Week 18) or the EOT visit, whichever occurs first for patients not entering Maintenance.

# Maintenance Study Period

The period starting from the First Dose Date (Maintenance Study Period) through the EOT visit following monotherapy discontinuation.

# Follow-Up Period

The period starting the day after the EOT visit through the Last Visit Date.

# Whole Study Period

The combined duration from Study Day 1 through the Last Visit Date, covering Induction, Maintenance (if applicable), and Follow-Up.

# General Calculation Rules:

- Ages and Years: All age-based calculations will use (Date of Interest - Date of Birth) / 365.25.
- Missing Dates: Handling of partial or missing dates for AEs and concomitant medications will be described in Section 4.4 [GAP: Section 4.4 not yet generated].
- Study Treatment: Refers to the combination of CT-P16 or EU-Approved Avastin with paclitaxel and carboplatin.
- Study Drug: Refers specifically to the investigational product (CT-P16) or the reference product (EU-Approved Avastin).

# Section 4.3: Multiplicity Adjustment

The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy similarity between CT-P16 and EU-Approved Avastin based on the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) during the Induction Study Period.

# 4.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in ORR, as described in Section 3.7. This corresponds to a significance level of α = 0.05 (two-sided). As there is only one primary endpoint and one pair-wise treatment comparison, no alpha-splitting or adjustment for multiple primary comparisons is required.

To conclude therapeutic equivalence, similarity must be demonstrated in both the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) populations (see Section 3.3). Because similarity must be shown in both populations to support the primary objective, no further adjustment to the Type I error rate is necessary for these dual analyses.

# 4.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

Formal hypothesis testing will not be performed for secondary efficacy endpoints (including ORR during the Whole Study Period, response duration, TTP, PFS, and OS). As established in Section 3.7, these endpoints are considered supportive and will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 95% CIs. All p-values generated for secondary endpoints will be intended for descriptive purposes and will not be adjusted for multiplicity.

# 4.3.3 Interim and Multiple Analyses

As described in Section 3.4 (Timing of Analysis), the study involves multiple data cuts and reports:

1. Induction Study Period Analysis: This is the definitive analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint.
2. One-Year Follow-up Analysis: Evaluation of long-term safety and secondary efficacy.
3. Final Analysis: Evaluation of the Whole Study Period.

Although the study will be unblinded to pre-defined personnel after the Induction Study Period (see Section 3.4.2), no interim analyses for the purpose of early stopping for efficacy or futility are planned (see Section 7.6.7). Consequently, no alpha spending functions or stopping boundaries are required to control the Type I error rate across these different time points. The primary efficacy conclusion is based solely on the analysis performed after the Induction Study Period.


# 4.3.4 Safety and Subgroup Analyses

All safety analyses (as defined in Section 2.2.1) and subgroup analyses (as described in Section 7.5) are exploratory. No multiplicity adjustments will be applied to these analyses. All results, including p-values and CIs, will be interpreted descriptively.

# Section 4.5: Visit Windows

Nominal visits will be used for all analysis and reporting. Visit windows will not be derived.

# Section 6: Efficacy Analyses

# 6.1 Analyses Supporting Primary Objective(s)

[Note: The primary efficacy analysis of Objective Response Rate (ORR) is detailed here in the final SAP. As per the current generation instructions, this section is acknowledged but the focus of this output is on the secondary efficacy endpoint.]

# 6.2 Analyses Supporting Secondary Objective(s)

# 6.2.1 Secondary Endpoint: Progression-Free Survival (PFS)

# 6.2.1.1 Definition of Endpoint

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the first documented occurrence of progressive disease (PD) as determined by the Independent Tumor Review Committee (see Section 9.3.2) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

PFS (days) = [Date of Event or Censoring] – [Date of Randomization] + 1.

For analysis in months, days will be converted as: PFS (months) = PFS (days) / 30.4375.

Assessments used for this endpoint are those specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 11.1) and follow the criteria described in Section 11.2 (RECIST v.1.1).

# 6.2.1.2 Primary Analysis of Secondary Endpoint

The primary analysis for PFS will be performed on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population (as defined in Section 3.3).

The distribution of PFS will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. The following statistics will be presented:

- Median PFS time with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method.
- PFS rates at landmark time points (e.g., 6, 9, and 12 months) with corresponding 95% CIs.
- A KM plot of the survival function will be produced showing the CT-P16 and EU-Approved Avastin arms.

The hazard ratio (HR) and its associated 95% CI will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The model will include treatment group as a fixed effect and will be stratified by the randomization stratification factors defined in Section 5.1:

- Country
- Sex (Female vs. Male)
- Disease Status (Recurrence vs. Metastatic)
- ECOG performance score (0 vs. 1)

A two-sided stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the PFS distributions between the two treatment groups. As described in Section 4.3, no multiplicity adjustment will be applied; the p-value will be interpreted descriptively.

# 6.2.1.3 Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses of Secondary Endpoint

The following supportive analyses will be conducted for PFS:

1. Per-Protocol (PP) Population Analysis: The primary analysis methodology described in Section 6.2.1.1.2 will be repeated using the PP Population (as defined in Section 3.3) to assess the robustness of results to protocol deviations.
2. Unstratified Analysis: An unstratified log-rank test and an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model will be performed on the ITT population.
3. Local Review Analysis: PFS will be re-analyzed using the investigator's local tumor assessments instead of the central review to evaluate the impact of assessment source.


# 6.2.1.4 Handling of Missing Data and Intercurrent Events

Missing data and intercurrent events (ICEs) for PFS will be handled using a "Hypothetical" and "Treatment Policy" hybrid strategy, consistent with oncology precedents for biosimilar trials:

| Situation                                                                   | Date of Progression or Censoring                             | Outcome  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| No baseline or no post-baseline tumor assessment                            | Date of randomization                                        | Censored |
| Progression or death documented between scheduled visits                    | Date of PD or death                                          | Event    |
| Progression or death documented after exactly one missing tumor assessment  | Date of PD or death                                          | Event    |
| Progression or death documented after two or more missing tumor assessments | Date of last adequate assessment prior to the missing visits | Censored |
| No progression or death at the time of data cut-off or study withdrawal     | Date of last adequate assessment                             | Censored |
| Start of a new anti-cancer therapy prior to progression or death            | Date of last adequate assessment prior to therapy start      | Censored |

Adequate assessments are defined as those where a response of CR, PR, or SD is documented. If an assessment is "NE" (Inevaluable) or missing, it is not considered adequate. Baseline is defined in Section 4.2.

# Section 7: Safety Analyses

# 7.1 Safety Analysis

Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population as defined in Section 3.3. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. Safety will be assessed through the evaluation of clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and physical examination findings, as well as the monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and immunogenicity.

Descriptive statistics for safety parameters will be presented as described in Section 4.1.

# 7.1.3 Clinical Laboratory Panels

Clinical laboratory assessments include hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation. Laboratory samples will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 11.1). Clinical laboratory test samples will be analyzed at the local laboratory for routine monitoring; however, data will be standardized to International System (SI) units for reporting and analysis.

# 7.1.3.1 Laboratory Categories

- Hematology: Hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and platelets.
- Clinical Chemistry: Albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) isoenzyme, total cholesterol, creatinine, creatinine clearance (CrCl) (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula, see Section 11.6), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and uric acid.
- Urinalysis: Bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, protein, specific gravity, and urobilinogen via dipstick. Microscopic examination and 24-hour urine collection (for protein) will be performed if indicated.
- Coagulation: Prothrombin time (PT) and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (INR) (for patients receiving aspirin).

# 7.1.3.2 Analysis Timepoints

Baseline is defined in Section 4.2. Post-baseline summaries will include all scheduled visits during the Induction Study Period (Cycles 1 through 6), Maintenance Study Period (Cycles 1 and every 3 cycles thereafter), and the End of Treatment (EOT) visit.
All laboratory data will be included in the data listings. Summaries of actual values and change from baseline will be provided for hematology and clinical chemistry. Coagulation and urinalysis results will be presented in data listings only.

# 7.1.3.3 Descriptive Summary Statistics

Laboratory parameters will be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics. Summaries will include both actual values and change from baseline values. As established in Section 4.5, nominal visits will be used for these summaries. Only scheduled visits will be included in by-visit summaries.

# 7.1.3.4 Toxicity Grading and Shift Tables

Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, where applicable.

Shift tables will be used to summarize the number and percentage of patients by baseline category (Grade 0 through 4) versus the worst post-baseline category. Worst post-baseline value is defined as the most extreme CTCAE grade observed during the Whole Study Period (as defined in Section 4.2), including results from unscheduled assessments.

For parameters not covered by CTCAE grading, shift tables will cross-classify patients by baseline category (Low, Normal, High) relative to the laboratory reference range versus the worst post-baseline category. Analyses will be performed separately for the "High" and "Low" directions when both are clinically relevant (e.g., potassium).

# 7.1.3.5 Treatment-Emergent Abnormalities

The number and percentage of patients with treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities (defined as an increase in CTCAE grade from baseline) will be summarized by treatment group. Particular focus will be placed on Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities.

# 7.1.3.6 Handling of Unscheduled and Duplicate Assessments

Unscheduled laboratory assessments will be excluded from by-visit summaries but will be included in the determination of the worst post-baseline values and in all listings.

If multiple laboratory values are collected on the same study day, the value collected closest to the scheduled assessment time will be used for by-visit summaries. For the determination of the worst post-baseline value, the most extreme value among all results (scheduled or unscheduled) for that day will be used.

# 11.1.2 Footnotes for Schedule of Events

1. Informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedures.
2. Screening evaluations will be completed within 28 days prior to randomization. However, screening period can be extended to 8 weeks exclusively for treating patients who have CNS metastases before starting the study treatment.
3. nsNSCLC history includes smoking history, AJCC staging, pathological characteristics, and prior anti-cancer treatments.
4. Predominant nsNSCLC should be confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining or immunohistochemistry before randomization. Gene screening for EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement will be also confirmed before randomization.
5. Randomization will be performed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the Induction Study Period.
6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (0 vs. 1).
7. Physical examinations will be performed before study treatment administration.
8. Clinical laboratory tests for Cycle 1 of the Induction Study Period will be performed within 14 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the Induction Study Period. Thereafter, clinical laboratory tests will be performed within 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle. Coagulation (prothrombin time and prothrombin time international normalized ratio) test will be performed at Screening, Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of Induction Study Period and when clinically indicated for the patient who has been administered aspirin. Clinical laboratory test samples will be analyzed at the local laboratory.
9. Urine pregnancy test should be performed at the Screening visit (within 3 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1), within 3 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the Maintenance Study Period and EOT visit, or at any time if pregnancy is suspected in females of childbearing potential only. If the urine pregnancy test gives equivocal results, a serum pregnancy test will be performed to exclude pregnant women in this study. For the Screening visit, only patients who have confirmed negative pregnancy test results will be included in this study. Pregnancy test samples will be analyzed at the local laboratory.
10. 12-lead ECG at the Screening visit will be performed within 14 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the Induction Study Period. For all other cycles, 12-lead ECG will be performed within 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle.
11. These assessments should be performed prior to study treatment administration.
12. Vital signs (including blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates, and temperature) will be assessed prior to study drug administration and be measured after 5 minutes of rest (sitting). Height will be assessed at Screening only as a baseline measurement.
13. Paclitaxel and carboplatin will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle in Induction Study Period.
14. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Day 1 of each cycle (prior to the beginning of the study drug administration [-3 days as window are allowed]) in the Induction Study Period, on Day 1 (-3 days as window are allowed) of Cycle 1 and every 3 cycles (end of Cycle 3, Cycle 6, and Cycle 9...) in the Maintenance Study Period, and EOT visit. In patients whose dose is delayed from the planned schedule, serum blood samples will be obtained on Day 22 of the last cycle (-3 days as window are allowed). Pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed at the central laboratory.
15. Tumor evaluation will be assessed at Screening and every 2 cycles during the Induction Study Period and every 3 cycles during the Maintenance Study Period, and at the EOT visit. During the Follow-Up Period, it will be performed every 9 weeks until PD, death, withdrawal or start of new anti-cancer therapy if PD is not confirmed during the Induction or Maintenance Study Periods.
16. Tumor assessment will be performed within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment.
17. Brain CT or MRI will be assessed at Screening as mandatory to assess brain metastasis. During the study, imaging will be performed for patients with brain metastasis at baseline or for any suspected new lesions.
18. Bone scans will be assessed at Screening as mandatory. During the study, scans will be performed for patients with bone metastasis at baseline or for any suspected new lesions.
19. Immunogenicity will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (predose), every 2 cycles during the Induction Study Period, every 3 cycles during the Maintenance Study Period and EOT visit. In the Follow-Up period, immunogenicity will be assessed once at the first visit of Follow-Up Period (9th week). A window of -3 days before Day 1 of the next cycle are allowed. In patients whose dose is delayed from the planned schedule, serum blood samples will be obtained on Day 22 of the last cycle (-3 days as window are allowed).
20. Quality of life should be assessed within 7 days before Day 1 of the next cycle, except screening assessment.
21. All medications used during the study, as well as all medications taken within 30 days of Day 1 of Cycle 1 in the Induction Study Period and until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. Concomitant medications relevant to serious adverse drug reactions (ADR) occurred after the EOT visit will also be collected. For patients who do not enter the Follow-Up Period, the last assessed concomitant medications will be collected.
22. Adverse events will be assessed from the date the informed consent form is signed until up to 28 days from last dose of study drug, regardless of the relationship to the study drug. Where an ADR is ongoing at the EOT visit, the ADR will be followed until one of the following: resolution or improvement from baseline, relationship reassessed as unrelated, start of new anti-cancer therapy, confirmation from the investigator that no further improvement can be expected, end of collection of clinical or safety data, or final database closure. For patients who do not enter the Follow-Up Period, the last assessed status of AEs will be collected.
23. Serious ADRs occurring during the Follow-Up Period will be reported and followed up.
